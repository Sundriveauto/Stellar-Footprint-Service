Include as much detail as possible:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept
- Affected versions or components
- Any suggested mitigations (optional)

## Disclosure Timeline

| Stage | Target timeframe |
|---|---|
| Acknowledgement | Within **48 hours** of report |

| Fix developed & reviewed | Within **30 days** (critical issues prioritised) |

## Responsible Disclosure

We are committed to working with security researchers in good faith. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Report vulnerabilities privately following this policy
- Do not access, modify, or delete data beyond what is needed to demonstrate the issue
- Do not disrupt the service or other users
